I. Introduction

Background and Context
## Research Problem Statement & Objectives of the Study
1. **Vulnerability Assessment for COVID-19 Risk:**
    - "Assess the vulnerability of different population groups to COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes in Latin America, examining socio-demographic factors, underlying health conditions, and access to healthcare services."
2. **Analysis of COVID-19 Variants Spread:**
    - "Study the transmission dynamics and spread of COVID-19 variants across Latin American countries, exploring genomic data and travel patterns to understand the emergence and dissemination of new variants."
3. **Predictive Modeling for COVID-19 Outbreaks:**
    - "Develop a predictive model to forecast COVID-19 outbreaks in Latin American countries using machine learning techniques, considering socio-economic factors, healthcare infrastructure, and mobility patterns."
